Please follow the steps in this README to run the "tausworthe.py" file and the application in the "app.py" file.

1. Download this repository.
2. Do not delete or add anything to the folder. Do not move any of the files within the folder or subfolder.
3. The subfolder "templates" should contain "index.html" and "results.html".
   - These files are necessary when running the "app.py" file.
4. The main folder should contain "tausworthe.py", "app.py", and this README file.
5. Navigate to your main folder in your chosen IDE or command-line interface.
6. Run the "tausworthe.py" file in your chosen IDE or command-line interface.
   - This will print the distribution returned from my final Tausworthe generator.
   - It will also print the results of my statistical tests, and generate multiple graphs.
7. Run the "app.py" file in your chosen IDE or command-line interface.
   - Open a local server at http://127.0.0.1:5000 (the link will appear in the output when you run "app.py").
   - This will open a Flask application in your web browser in which you can enter parameter values.
   - Once the parameter values have been entered, press "Run", and the appropriate distribution will be returned.
